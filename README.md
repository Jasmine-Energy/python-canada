# Canada: A Glorious Package for Canada

A package for easily working with data about Canada's provinces and territories.

Much like our great country, this package is mostly, but not entirely, drop-in compatible with the great `us` [package](https://github.com/unitedstates/python-us) of America.


## Installation

As per usual:

```
pip install canada
```
